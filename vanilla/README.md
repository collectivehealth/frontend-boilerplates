# Vanilla JS

This is a very simple blank HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate. jQuery available and loaded by default. the default gulp process runs a webserver with livereload and file watchers.

If you want framework specific tasks please use one of the other directories to save everyone time setting up boilerplate code.
