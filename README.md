# Frontend Interview boilerplates

This repo contains a collection of basic boilerplate apps in various modern frontend frameworks to be used during Frontend Engineer interviews

There are five boilerplates:
* Vanilla JS (with jQuery)
* AngularJS
* Angular
* React
* Vue

Each boilerplate supports es2015 (including modules), SCSS, livereloading, etc... Check the package.json and webpack.config.js in each boilerplate to see project specifics.

* run `npm install` to install the boilerplate toolchain dependencies
* run `npm start` to launch the web server
