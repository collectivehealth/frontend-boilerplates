# Frontend Interview Boilerplates

This repo contains a collection of basic boilerplate apps in various modern frontend frameworks to be used during Frontend Engineer interviews.

ES6 is available for all boilerplates should a candidate want to use it.

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run`. This will default to the "vanilla" source folder.
4. Access the boilerplate app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Specifying A Source Folder

By default, `npm run` will use source from the "vanilla" folder. The following commands can be issued to use an alternative boilerplate source directory:

`npm run angular`

`npm run backbone`

`npm run react`

### Running Tests

To run tests for a specific boilerplate source, run: `npm run test vanilla/test`, substituting the directory of your choice.

### Reset!

Don't forget to run `git reset --hard` to reset the local repository after each interview.
